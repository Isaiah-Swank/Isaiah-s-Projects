            <h2> Coding </h2>
        

            <p>
                I became interested in coding my senior year of highschool and have throughly enjoyed learning more about the software world.
                In my free time I like to code projects to diversify my skills such as this personal website to teach myself HTML and CSS.
                However, I have always been into videogames and have been making small games in Python for my younger siblings to play when I go home.
                I am currently working on a robot 2D scroller my 5 year old brother asked for. Mixing with my love for sports, I also have been working on designs and algorithms for a sports betting advice website I would like to make.

            <h2> Sports and Leadership </h2>
            <p>
                Since I was young, I have always loved sports. I grew up playing baseball, basketball, football, and golfing. 
                I believe sports adds a lot of value to people growing into complete adults. The exercise comes with sports helps with my mental and physical health.
                I grew up very overweight and learning to put those practices into my daily life taught me discipline and how to better schedule my time.
                However I believe the most important aspect and the one I love the most is leadership. Many of the leaderships skills I have acquired over the years has come from sports.
                There are many different personalities on a team, and as a leader you need to learn how to approach each member in a way that gets the best out of them.
                Leaders also learn when to take charge and get the team back up, as well as when to take a step back and let someone else lead when needed.
                Because of sports, I have been able to transfer these skills to other aspects of my life like in the classroom and being a leader for my church group on campus.

            <h2> Family and Everyday Life </h2>

            <p>
                One of the most important things in my life is my family. A great vacation to me is being able to spend some quality time with my loved ones without a worry.
                Being the second oldest of nine, I have had the privledge to grow up helping my parents with the kids. This led to me learning and loving to cook for them, and that gave me a skill that would end up being a job.
                My favorite activity to do with my family is swimming whether its taking my siblings to the pool or going down to the Colorado river near the house.
                This has made me excited to be a father later in life and helps me keep in mind to stay on my goals, to set my kids up for a stable life.
                While I'm not at that point, that means I try to be as good of a role model for my siblings as I can. I will never be perfect, but I trust God to lead me in the right direction and help me do my best to treat everyone around me in love.
