        <p>
        I am a soon to be 21 year old student in the Spring semester of my junior year at <b>Northern Arizona University</b>. I am from Palisade, Colorado which is a big agricultural area on the western desert side of the state.
        Family is one of the most important parts of my life, I grew up the second oldest of nine kids and with that came a lot of lessons.
        It taught me the value of responsibility when others are counting on you, how to communicate with all different kinds of people in a loving way, and how to stand my ground for what's right even in the face of fear.
        I am incredibly grateful to grow up the way I did because while it may not have been easy, those hard times and lessons shaped me into the man I am today.
