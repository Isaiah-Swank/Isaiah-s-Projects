# Isaiah Swank's Software Projects
Here is an organized Github of all the projects I am working on outside of my classes. I am always trying to sharpen my skills and add different tools to my knowledge. My current interest is in making games and learning clean web design so a lot of my current projects are HTML and CSS based.
I am currently working on a mini-game project in pygame to learn how to apply my game knowledge across multiple langauges before approaching C#. 
As well as learning how to make professional looking websites that future businesses could possibly use.
While I am no expert by any means, I am proud of the work I have done so far because I can look back and see the progress I have made in each project.
